Learnings :

1. Building Web design with Bootstrap : I used bootstrap grid system and components like navbar, carousel, cards and row-columns classes. Helped to understand to structure a layout that adopts to all screen sizes without writing tons of CSS. 



2. Modals and Carousals : Implemented Modals for Rent and Contact forms, carousal for homepage which added interactivity and dynamic features to the project.



3. Modular and Scalable UI using Cards: Implemented bootstrap cards to organise services and Bike Rental options. Learned to repeat structure to display different kinds of data (titles, descriptions, prices, buttons) for easy to scan and scale up features.



4. Structuring Forms with modern UX pattern : Created a form inside a modal with form-floating inputs, dropdowns and submit button.The UX was clean and can lead to higher conversion and better satisfaction of customers.
