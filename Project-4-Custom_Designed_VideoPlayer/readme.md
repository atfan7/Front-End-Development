Project Title : Customizable Video Player

Learnings:

1. DOM Manipulation & Event Handling: Learned the art of choosing elements, attaching event listeners and changing elements dynamically such as buttons and progress bars.

2. Media Controls: Got hands-on experience controlling video playback with JavaScript through play(), pause(), and currentTime methods.

3. Responsive Design: Employed CSS media queries to make the video player responsive to various screen sizes so it functions well on both desktop and mobile platforms.
