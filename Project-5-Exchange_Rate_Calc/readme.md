Project Title : Currency Exchange Rate Calculator 

Learnings:

1. Dynamic exchange rate calculation: This project retrieves live exchange rates via an API and dynamically updates the conversion based on the user input. This taught me how to deal with external APIs and dynamically change data on a webpage.

2. User interface design: The simple and intuitive UI where users can easily switch currencies and input amounts helped me in applying the good design principles for a working tool.

3. Working with different CSS and HTML rules: This project enhanced my proficiency in applying different CSS and HTML regulations for responsive design and custom styling.
