Learnings:

1. Use of CSS rule and efficient DOM Manipulation: This project illustrates how to manipulate the DOM in real-time, picking and changing elements like seats and prices according to user interactions plus design change with CSS rules.

2. Managing User Inputs with Event Listeners : By using addEventListener(), the code is able to catch events such as movie selection and seat clicks in real time thus making the UI update responsive.

3. Real-time State Management : The code dynamically computes the number of seats selected and their price making state management critical in client-side applications using JavaScript.
